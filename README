# qcal

qcal is a quick calendar application for CalDAV servers written in Go. In
contrast to other tools it does not cache anything. It can fetch multiple
servers / calendars in parallel which makes it quite fast.

Its main purpose is displaying calendar data. Nevertheless it supports basic
creation and editing of entries.

## Features

- condensed quick overview of appointments
- parallel fetching of multiple calendars
- easy to use filters
- create, modify and delete appointments
- import ICS files
- display ICS files
- easy setup


## Installation

- Have Go installed
- make && sudo make install
- copy config-sample.json to ~/.config/qcal/config.json and modify accordingly


## neomutt / other cli mail tools

You can view received appointments in neomutt with qcal! Put this in your
mailcap (usually in .config/neomutt):

    text/calendar; qcal -p; copiousoutput


## Crontab 

    EVENT=$(qcal -cron 15); [[ $EVENT ]] && notify-send "Next Appointment:" "\n$EVENT"

If using systemd put the above line in a script and run the script every 15mins
with

    systemd-run --user --on-calendar=*:0/15 ~/bin/qcal-cron-sh
